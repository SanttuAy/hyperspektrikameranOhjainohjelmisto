Name:
Linear scanner controller

Description:
The controller program for a linear scanner that moves a hyperspectral camera. 
The python-program is used from a PC, and it moves the camera in a self-built linear scanner, 
which consists of (in addition to the metal rails) Arduino microprocessor, three stepper motors, six limit switches. 
In Arduino, StandardFirmataPlus-sketch is applied.

The controller does not include graphical UI. 
It is intended to be used from a command line, in the future, in conjunction with an imaging software.

Visuals:
Please, see the picture linear_scanner_of_hyperspectral_camera.jpg in the root of the project.


Authors and acknowledgment:
The controller has been developed while working in the hyperspectral laboratory of the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä. 
I want to thank the staff of the laboratory for their guidance and support during the process.
